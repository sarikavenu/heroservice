# heroservice
This is the actual service which manages the CRUD operation of Heros. This is configured to invoke via Gateway and Eureka services part of standard spring architecture.

## Deployment
I have deployed and tested this in OpenShift, you can quickly spin a pod and try using an application type of Git and Java.

## Routes
I have not published any route as services are always invoked by Gateway and Eureka.
